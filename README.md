# VideoGames API Rest with Swagger

This is a small api that contains all the existing games released on the ***Gameboy Advance*** and ***Super Nintendo Entertainment System*** with the aim of showing how ***Swagger*** can be used to implement all the documentation in a way that makes it easier to understand how it works.
Both the api repository and the json that make up the database are available for you to use however you want.

# Installation

To start the api, just run the command:

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 maydoubt/videogames_api`

And access to: http://localhost:3000/api/docs to see all the documentation about the api.
